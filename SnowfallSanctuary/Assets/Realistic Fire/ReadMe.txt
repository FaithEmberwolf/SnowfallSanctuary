You will find "Fire" prefab in Assets\Resources\Prefabs.
You will find demo scene called "FireScene" in the Demo folder.
When you run the demo scene you should see a fire surrounded by a few objects.
Fire should appear first, smoke and sparks should emerge after a short delay.

"Fire" system consists of 4 particle systems and a point light.

1) Flames Particles system renders flames (using Texture sheet animation).
2) Smoke Particles system renders smoke (using Texture sheet animation).
3) Spark Particle system renders sparks that flight out and spread in the space above the fire.
4) Base particles add glow effect to the base of the fire.

Thanks for buying this asset! Good luck!


Version 1.1 fixed some minor bugs pointed out by customers and added few more particle prefabs that share same resources (textures and materials) with the default realistic fire prefab yet have completely different appearance.

FrostWisp (Based on smoke sprites)
SmokeBubble (Based on smoke sprites)
PlasmaBubble (Based on desaturated fire sprites)
FlamesDot (Based on standard fire sprites)

Customer support. Asset is there for about 5-6 months and there was a only one question.

Q:	How can I make it smaller?
A:	Here is the video on how to do it. http://youtu.be/egquLJuX9nE 
	
	You have to adjust following parameters.
	
	Start Size
	Start Speed
	Gravity Modifier
	Shape radius (or dimensions xyz)
	Velocity over lifetime (if it is enabled)
	Force over lifetime (if it is enabled)

	You have to do it many times since this prefab contains more than one particle system.
	You can see on the video that I have scaled every single particle system 10 times.
